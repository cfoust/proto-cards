* _pinyin_ for almost all words that shows/hides with a button
* Pronunciation by native speakers for ~60% of words
* Definitions in English
* Link that quickly searches the word in [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com/) (Note: I don't have an Android device, so I'm unsure this works there.)

## Notes

This deck's word list was clearly source from a corpus of court proceedings, film production, and theatrical productions, which is strange. There are occasionally words that were common in the source text but may not be as commonly used in everyday life. Despite that I've found the deck to be quite useful and I haven't felt that it's diminished my acquisition of the language. Sometimes I just skip/exclude cards that seem too esoteric.
